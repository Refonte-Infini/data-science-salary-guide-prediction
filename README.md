# Data Science Salary Guide Prediction

## Overview

**Data Science Salary Guide Prediction** is a project designed to predict salaries for data science and related roles in the year 2025. It uses six robust models to calculate salary projections, including:

1. **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** - Extracts structured information (roles, levels, and salary ranges) from unstructured job descriptions.
2. **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)** - Predicts steady growth in salaries based on historical data.
3. **Inflation Adjustment Model** - Accounts for changes in purchasing power over time.
4. **Skills Premium Weighting Model** - Adds salary adjustments based on high-demand skills (e.g., Python, SQL, Machine Learning).
5. **Demand and Geographic Growth Model** - Factors in job market demand and regional salary variations.
6. **Weighted Regression Model** - Refines predictions using statistical analysis based on experience, skills, and location.

This repository provides implementations in **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **Java**, each placed in dedicated folders.
